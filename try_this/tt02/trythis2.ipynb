    "Suppose that the probability of exposure to the flux during an epidemic is 0.6.  Experience has shown that a serum is 80% successful in preventing an inoculated person from acquiring the flux, if exposed.  A person not innoculated faces a probability of 0.90 of acquiring the flux if exposed.  Two persons, one inoculated and one not, are capable of performing a essential task in business.  Assume that they are not at the same location, are not in contact with the same people, and cannot expose one another.  What is the probability that at least one will get the flu?"
